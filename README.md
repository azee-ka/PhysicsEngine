# PhysicsEngine

Physics Engine

This is a simple physics engine written in Python using Pygame. It provides a basic framework for simulating the motion of particles based on Newtonian physics principles.

Features

Simulates the motion of particles in a 2D environment
Supports basic physics principles such as gravity, friction, and collisions
Provides a visualization of the particle motion using Pygame
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pygame (install using pip install pygame)
Installation
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/physics-engine.git
Install the required dependencies:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main.py file to start the physics simulation:
sh
Copy code
python main.py
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the particles.
