# Physics Engine

A simple physics engine written in Python using Pygame. The engine provides a framework for simulating the motion of particles based on Newtonian physics principles.

## Features

- Simulates the motion of particles in a 2D environment
- Supports basic physics principles such as gravity, friction, and collisions
- Provides a visualization of the particle motion using Pygame

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (install using `pip install pygame`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/physics-engine.git
