# Physics Engine

A simple physics engine written in Python using Pygame. The engine provides a framework for simulating the motion of particles based on Newtonian physics principles in a 3D environment.

## Features

- Simulates the motion of particles in a 3D environment
- Supports basic physics principles such as gravity, friction, and collisions
- Provides a visualization of the particle motion using Pygame

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (install using `pip install pygame`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:   
2. Install the required dependencies:

### Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the physics simulation:
